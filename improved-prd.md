## 6. User Flow

### Primary Flow: NFC-Triggered Note Creation
1. User taps NFC tag on Rocketbook cover
2. Phone reads URI (e.g., `rocketnotes://work`)
3. App launches/switches to corresponding mode
4. User creates/views notes in that context
5. Notes auto-save with mode metadata

### Secondary Flow: Manual Note Management
1. User opens app directly
2. Selects mode manually or continues in last mode
3. Creates, edits, or searches notes
4. Optional: Triggers AI analysis or export

---

## 7. UI/UX Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Minimal Taps:** Max 2 taps to create a note
- **Visual Context:** Clear color coding (blue=work, green=personal)
- **Speed First:** Sub-second NFC response time
- **Offline Ready:** Full functionality without internet

### Key Screens
1. **Home/Mode View:** Large mode indicator, quick note button
2. **Note Editor:** Minimal UI, focus on content
3. **Note List:** Filterable grid/list with search
4. **Settings:** NFC tag management, sync options

---

## 8. Data Model

### Note Entity
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "content": "string",
  "mode": "work|personal",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "updated_at": "timestamp",
  "tags": ["string"],
  "ai_summary": "string",
  "attachments": ["uri"],
  "nfc_tag_id": "string"
}
```

### NFC Tag Entity
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "uri": "rocketnotes://mode",
  "label": "string",
  "color": "hex",
  "created_at": "timestamp"
}
```
