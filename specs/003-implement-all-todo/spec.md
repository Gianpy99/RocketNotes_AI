# Feature Specification: Complete TODO Implementation & Remove Mockups

**Feature Branch**: `003-implement-all-todo`  
**Created**: 2025-09-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement all TODO items and replace mockup implementations with real functionality throughout the RocketNotes AI application. This includes removing placeholder/mockup code and implementing actual business logic, API integrations, data persistence, UI interactions, and any other pending development tasks marked with TODO comments."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified need to implement all TODO items and replace mockups with real functionality
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developers, family members, app users
   → Actions: Complete TODO implementations, replace mockups, integrate services
   → Data: Family data, shared notes, notifications, user preferences
   → Constraints: Maintain existing functionality, preserve data integrity
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Implementation approaches are well-defined in existing TODO comments
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Users expect complete functionality without placeholders
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each TODO item becomes a functional requirement
   → Mock implementations must be replaced with real business logic
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Family members, shared notes, notifications, permissions, user preferences
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Comprehensive implementation plan covering all pending work
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for implementation)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a RocketNotes AI user, I want all application features to work completely without placeholder messages or mock implementations, so that I can use the full functionality for managing family notes, sharing content, and receiving notifications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to create a family, **When** they complete the family creation form, **Then** the family is actually created in the backend with all members properly configured
2. **Given** a family member wants to share a note, **When** they select sharing options, **Then** the note is actually shared with real-time notifications sent to recipients
3. **Given** a user receives a family invitation, **When** they accept it, **Then** they are actually added to the family with proper permissions and notification preferences
4. **Given** a user wants to use voice features, **When** they activate voice input, **Then** actual speech-to-text processing occurs instead of placeholder text
5. **Given** a user wants to backup their data, **When** they trigger backup, **Then** actual encryption and backup processes execute instead of mock implementations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when family operations fail due to network issues?
- How does the system handle notification delivery failures?
- What occurs when voice recognition services are unavailable?
- How are permission conflicts resolved during family member management?
