# Implementation Plan: Complete TODO Implementation & Remove Mockups

**Branch**: `003-implement-all-todo` | **Date**: 2025-09-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-implement-all-todo/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Complete implementation of all TODO items and replacement of mockup code with real functionality throughout the RocketNotes AI application. Priority focus on family management, shared notes, and notification systems to provide complete user experience for family note-taking and collaboration. Maintain existing Flutter mobile architecture while implementing missing backend integrations and service completions.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Dart 3.1+, Flutter 3.13+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase SDK, Hive (local storage), Riverpod (state management), flutter_local_notifications  
**Storage**: Firebase Firestore (cloud), Hive (local persistence), SharedPreferences (settings)  
**Testing**: Flutter integration tests, widget tests, contract tests following existing pattern  
**Target Platform**: Android mobile (primary), cross-platform Flutter  
**Project Type**: Mobile (Flutter app with Firebase backend)  
**Performance Goals**: Real-time sync <2s, voice processing <3s, notification delivery <1s  
**Constraints**: Maintain offline capability, preserve existing data, backward compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Family groups 2-10 members, 1000+ notes per family, real-time collaboration  
**User Priority Context**: Don't change architecture unless strictly necessary, maintain current approach, implement by family usage priority

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Flutter mobile app with Firebase backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes (Firebase SDK, Flutter widgets, no unnecessary wrapper classes)
- Single data model? Yes (consistent models across family, notes, notifications)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (direct service usage, no Repository pattern - Firebase provides sufficient abstraction)

**Architecture**:
- Feature-based structure: Yes (family/, shared_notes/, notifications/ features)
- Libraries: Core services (family_service, shared_notes_service, notification_service)
- CLI: Flutter CLI commands (build, test, run)
- Library docs: Comprehensive inline documentation and README files

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle: Will be enforced for all TODO implementations
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes, following existing TDD pattern
- Order: Contract→Integration→Unit strictly followed? Yes, maintaining existing test structure
- Real dependencies used? Yes (Firebase services, actual FCM for notifications)
- Integration tests for: TODO completions, service integrations, contract changes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging: Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics integration
- Frontend logs → backend: Firebase logging pipeline
- Error context: Comprehensive error tracking with user context

**Versioning**:
- Version number: Following existing app versioning (increment BUILD for TODO completions)
- BUILD increments: On every TODO completion
- Breaking changes: Maintain backward compatibility for existing family data

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 3: Mobile + API (Flutter mobile app with Firebase backend services)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
