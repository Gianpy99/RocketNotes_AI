# Feature Specification: Complete Shared Notes Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `feature/complete-shared-notes-implementation`  
**Created**: 8 settembre 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Complete all TODO items in the codebase marked with //TODO: to finish the shared notes and comment system implementation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: Complete all TODO implementations for shared notes system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: Shared notes, comments, replies, user management, data loading, navigation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for shared notes functionality
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a family member, I want to share notes with my family and engage in threaded conversations through comments and replies, so that I can collaborate effectively and keep track of important information and discussions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a note I want to share, **When** I select family members and set permissions, **Then** the note should be shared and visible to selected family members
2. **Given** I can see a shared note, **When** I add a comment, **Then** my comment should appear and be visible to other family members
3. **Given** I see a comment with replies, **When** I want to see all replies, **Then** I should be able to view the complete threaded conversation
4. **Given** I want to export a shared note, **When** I select export options and format, **Then** I should be able to download the note in my chosen format
5. **Given** I want to share a note externally, **When** I choose share options, **Then** I should be able to share the content or link via native sharing
4. **Given** I posted a comment, **When** I want to edit or delete it, **Then** I should have options to modify or remove my comment
5. **Given** I see a comment I like, **When** I tap the like button, **Then** my like should be recorded and the count should update

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access a shared note they no longer have permission for?
- How does the system handle comments on notes that get deleted?
- What happens when multiple users try to edit the same comment simultaneously?
- How are notifications handled for comment replies and likes?
- What happens when a family member gets removed while having active shared notes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to share notes with selected family members and set appropriate permissions
- **FR-002**: System MUST display shared notes in a list view with proper metadata (shared by, date, permissions)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable users to view shared notes with full content and metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to add comments to shared notes
- **FR-005**: System MUST support threaded replies to comments with proper nesting
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a way to view all replies in a comment thread
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow comment authors to edit their own comments
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow comment authors to delete their own comments
- **FR-009**: System MUST support liking comments with visual feedback and count updates
- **FR-010**: System MUST display actual user names instead of user IDs throughout the interface
- **FR-011**: System MUST load and display family members for note sharing selection
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle permission creation and validation for shared notes
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide export functionality for shared notes
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide share functionality for shared notes
- **FR-015**: System MUST send push notifications for family activities and comment interactions
- **FR-016**: System MUST integrate family settings into the main settings screen
- **FR-017**: System MUST integrate backup settings into the main settings screen
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide advanced shopping list features with family sharing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SharedNote**: Represents a note that has been shared with family members, including content, permissions, and metadata
- **Comment**: Represents a comment on a shared note, including content, author, timestamp, and likes
- **Reply**: Represents a reply to a comment, maintaining thread relationships
- **FamilyMember**: Represents a family member with display name, permissions, and relationship data
- **NotePermission**: Defines access levels and permissions for shared notes
- **User**: Represents a system user with authentication and profile information
