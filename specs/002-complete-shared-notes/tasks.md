## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   â†’ Plan loaded: Complete shared notes implementation strategy
2. Load optional design documents:
   â†’ spec.md: Extract requirements â†’ implementation tasks
   â†’ plan.md: Extract phases â†’ task organization
3. Generate tasks by category:
   â†’ Data Loading: User names, family members, shared notes
   â†’ Sharing: Permission creation, service integration
   â†’ Comments: CRUD operations, threading, replies
   â†’ UI Polish: Navigation, export, settings
4. Apply task rules:
   â†’ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   â†’ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   â†’ Service integration before UI features
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   â†’ All TODOs addressed?
   â†’ Dependencies respected?
   â†’ User experience complete?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```
