## Summary
Complete all TODO implementations across the shared notes system to deliver a fully functional family collaboration platform with threaded comments, proper user management, and comprehensive sharing capabilities.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Dart 3.x with Flutter Framework  
**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions), Riverpod for state management, Hive for local caching  
**Storage**: Firebase Firestore (remote), Hive (local caching)  
**Testing**: Flutter integration tests, unit tests with Mockito  
**Target Platform**: Android/iOS mobile applications  
**Project Type**: Mobile application  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms for data loading, <2s for complex operations  
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, real-time synchronization, biometric authentication  
**Scale/Scope**: Family-based (up to 20 members), note sharing with permissions, threaded comments  

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (Flutter mobile app)
- Using framework directly: Yes (Firebase, Flutter widgets)
- Single data model: Yes (consistent models across features)
- Avoiding patterns: Yes (service/repository pattern justified by Firebase integration)

**Architecture**:
- Feature-based structure: Yes (family/, shared_notes/ features)
- Libraries: Core services, feature-specific services
- CLI: Flutter build/run commands
- Documentation: Comprehensive READMEs and API docs

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle: Enforced through existing test structure
- Test-first approach: Contract and integration tests exist
- Order followed: Contractâ†’Integrationâ†’Unit
- Real dependencies: Firebase services used
- Integration tests: Comprehensive scenario coverage
- Implementation after tests: Following TDD approach

**Observability**:
- Structured logging: Firebase Crashlytics integration
- Error context: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- Audit logging: Implemented for family operations

**Versioning**:
- Version management: Flutter pubspec versioning
- Build increments: CI/CD pipeline handles versioning
- Breaking changes: Handled through migration strategies
