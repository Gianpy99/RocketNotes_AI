# Tasks: Family Management

**Input**: Design documents from `c:\Development\RocketNotes_AI\specs\001-family-management\`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack (Flutter, Firebase, Riverpod), libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 5 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 3 files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: 7 scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB connections, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Critical Path (Sequential)
- **Setup**: T001-T005 (all setup must complete first)
- **Tests**: T006-T015 (all tests must be written and failing before implementation)
- **Models**: T016-T020 (models before services)
- **Services**: T021-T029 (services before UI)
- **UI**: T030-T038 (UI after services)
- **Integration**: T039-T043 (integration after core features)
- **Polish**: T044-T051 (polish after everything else)

### Parallel Execution Groups
```
# Group 1 - Contract Tests (can run together):
T006: POST /api/families contract test
T007: POST /api/families/{id}/invitations contract test
T008: PUT /api/notes/{id}/share contract test

# Group 2 - Integration Tests (can run together):
T009-T015: All 7 integration test scenarios

# Group 3 - Data Models (can run together):
T016-T020: All 5 data model classes

# Group 4 - Services (can run together):
T021-T025: All 5 service/repository classes

# Group 5 - UI Screens (can run together):
T030-T038: All 9 UI screen implementations

# Group 6 - Polish Tasks (can run together):
T044-T051: All quality assurance and documentation tasks
```

## Task Details & File Specifications

### Example Task Execution
```
# To run contract tests in parallel:
T006: Create android-app/integration_test/contracts/test_create_family.dart
T007: Create android-app/integration_test/contracts/test_invite_member.dart
T008: Create android-app/integration_test/contracts/test_share_note.dart

# Each test should:
- Mock Firebase services
- Test request/response contracts
- Verify error handling
- Assert correct data validation
```
