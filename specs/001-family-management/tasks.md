## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack (Flutter, Firebase, Riverpod), libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 5 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 3 files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: 7 scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB connections, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Task Details & File Specifications

### Example Task Execution
```
# To run contract tests in parallel:
T006: Create android-app/integration_test/contracts/test_create_family.dart
T007: Create android-app/integration_test/contracts/test_invite_member.dart
T008: Create android-app/integration_test/contracts/test_share_note.dart

# Each test should:
- Mock Firebase services
- Test request/response contracts
- Verify error handling
- Assert correct data validation
```
