# Feature Specification: Family Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-family-management`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement family management features for multi-user family accounts and sharing"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (family members), actions (sharing, accounts), data (notes), constraints (privacy, permissions)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a family member, I want to share notes with my family so that we can collaborate on shopping lists, reminders, and important information while maintaining appropriate privacy controls.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has created a family account, **When** they invite another family member, **Then** the invited member receives an invitation and can join the family
2. **Given** a user is part of a family, **When** they create a note, **Then** they can choose to share it with specific family members or the entire family
3. **Given** a shared note exists, **When** a family member views it, **Then** they can see all content and make comments
4. **Given** a family member has edit permissions, **When** they modify a shared note, **Then** all family members see the changes in real-time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a family member leaves the family?
- How are permissions handled when a note is shared with multiple family members?
- What happens to shared notes when the original creator deletes their account?
- How does the system handle family members with different app versions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create family accounts with up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum family size not specified] members
- **FR-002**: System MUST support different permission levels for family members (view-only, edit, admin)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to invite family members via email or phone number
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow sharing individual notes with specific family members or the entire family
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time synchronization of shared notes across all family devices
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain privacy controls so family members can only see notes shared with them
- **FR-007**: System MUST support commenting on shared notes
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow family admins to manage member permissions and remove members
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide family activity feeds showing recent changes and comments
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle offline scenarios for shared notes with conflict resolution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Family**: Represents a family group with admin and members
- **FamilyMember**: Individual user within a family with specific permissions
- **SharedNote**: A note that has been shared with family members
- **NotePermission**: Defines what actions a family member can perform on a shared note
- **FamilyInvitation**: Pending invitation for a user to join a family
