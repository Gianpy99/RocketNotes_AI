## Key Files & Locations
| Purpose | Location | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Main application code | \src/\ | Core business logic |
| API/Backend | \src/backend/\ | Server-side code |
| Frontend/UI | \src/frontend/\ | User interface |
| Shared code | \src/shared/\ | Reusable components |
| Database configs | \configs/database/\ | Connection strings, schemas |

## Development Guidelines
1. **For New Features:** Start in \prototypes/\ or \sandbox/\, then move to \src/\
2. **For Research:** Use \esearch_spikes/\ and document findings
3. **For Data Work:** Raw data in \data/raw/\, processed in \data/processed/\
4. **For AI/ML:** Models in \models/\, training scripts in \src/agents/\
5. **For Documentation:** Keep \docs/\ updated with architecture decisions

## Claude Collaboration Notes
- Save important code snippets and solutions in \sandbox/claude_sessions/\
- Document architectural decisions in \docs/architecture/\
- Use \experiments/\ for testing new approaches
- Keep a running log of what works/doesn't work
