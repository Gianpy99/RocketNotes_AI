# RocketNotes AI - Environment Setup Guide

## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

### **STEP 1: Install Flutter** 

#### Windows Installation:
1. **Download Flutter SDK**
   ```bash
   # Download from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   # Extract to: C:\development\flutter
   ```

2. **Update PATH Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   # Add to System PATH:
   C:\development\flutter\bin
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   flutter doctor
   ```

#### Required Tools:
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **VS Code** (with Flutter/Dart extensions)
- **Git** (already installed)

### **STEP 2: Project Dependencies**

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Development\RocketNotes_AI\android-app

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Add test dependencies
flutter pub add dev:flutter_test
flutter pub add dev:mockito
flutter pub add dev:build_runner
flutter pub add dev:test

# Generate mock files
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

### **STEP 3: First Run Test**

```bash
# Run unit tests
flutter test

# Run the app in debug mode
flutter run

# Build for release
flutter build apk --release
```

## 🚀 **ALTERNATIVE: Quick Demo Deployment**

### **Option B: Deploy as Web Demo**

If you want to quickly demonstrate the app without full Flutter setup:

1. **Build Web Version**
   ```bash
   flutter build web
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Upload `build/web/` contents
   - Access via: `https://gianpy99.github.io/RocketNotes_AI`

3. **Or Deploy to Netlify/Vercel**
   - Drag & drop `build/web/` folder
   - Get instant live demo URL

### **Option C: Docker Development**

Use the existing Docker setup:

```bash
# Build development container
docker-compose up --build

# Run Flutter in container
docker run -it flutter-dev flutter --version
```

## 📱 **Testing Strategy (Without Full Setup)**

### **Code Review & Static Analysis**

```bash
# Lint checking (if Dart SDK available)
dart analyze lib/

# Format checking
dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib/
```

### **Manual Testing Checklist**

1. **Architecture Review** ✅
   - Clean Architecture compliance
   - Provider pattern implementation
   - Repository pattern usage

2. **Code Quality Review** ✅
   - File organization
   - Naming conventions
   - Error handling

3. **Feature Completeness** ✅
   - Core functionality present
   - UI components complete
   - Integration points defined

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Choose One)

### **Path 1: Full Development Setup** (1-2 days)

2. Setup Android Studio
3. Run tests and debug
4. Build APK for testing

### **Path 2: Quick Demo** (2-4 hours)
1. Build web version (if Flutter available elsewhere)
2. Deploy to hosting platform
3. Share demo link
4. Gather feedback

### **Path 3: Documentation & Planning** (immediate)
1. Complete documentation
2. Create installation guide
3. Plan testing strategy
4. Prepare for future development
