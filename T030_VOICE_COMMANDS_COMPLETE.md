## Integration Guide

### Adding Voice to Existing Screens
```dart
// Add floating voice button to any screen
Scaffold(
  body: YourScreenContent(),
  floatingActionButton: FloatingVoiceButton(
    onNavigate: (route) => Navigator.pushNamed(context, route),
    onAction: (data) => handleVoiceAction(data),
  ),
)

// Or use overlay mode
VoiceQuickActionsOverlay(
  enabled: true,
  child: YourScreenContent(),
)
```

### Voice Commands Usage
```dart
// Initialize voice service
final voiceService = VoiceCommandsService();
await voiceService.initialize();

// Start listening
await voiceService.startListening();

// Process command manually
final result = await voiceService.processVoiceCommand("create note shopping list");
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
