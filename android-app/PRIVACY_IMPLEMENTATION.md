# Privacy Implementation for Notes

## Overview
This document describes the privacy implementation for user notes in RocketNotes AI.

## Problem Identified
**CRITICAL PRIVACY ISSUE**: Notes were stored in Hive local storage without user isolation. This meant:
- All notes were visible to ANY user who logged in on the same device
- If User A logged out and User B logged in on the same device, User B would see User A's notes
- No userId tracking for note ownership

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `userId` Field to NoteModel
- Added `@HiveField(15) String? userId` to the NoteModel class
- Updated `copyWith`, `toJson`, and `fromJson` methods to include userId
- Regenerated Hive adapters using build_runner

### 2. Modified NoteRepository to Filter by UserId
**File**: `lib/data/repositories/note_repository.dart`

- Added `_currentUserId` getter that retrieves the current Firebase Auth user ID
- Modified `getAllNotes()` to filter notes by current user:
  ```dart
  var notes = notesBox.values.where((note) {
    // If note has no userId (old notes), OR note belongs to current user
    final hasNoUserId = note.userId == null || note.userId!.isEmpty;
    final belongsToCurrentUser = note.userId == currentUserId;
    return hasNoUserId || belongsToCurrentUser;
  }).toList()
  ```

- Modified `saveNote()` to automatically assign current userId:
  ```dart
  final noteToSave = note.userId == null
      ? note.copyWith(userId: _currentUserId)
      : note;
  ```

### 3. Fixed Firestore Index Error for Shared Notes
**File**: `lib/features/family/providers/family_providers.dart`

- Removed `.orderBy('sharedAt', descending: true)` from Firestore query (which required an index)
- Added in-memory sorting instead:
  ```dart
  notes.sort((a, b) => b.sharedAt.compareTo(a.sharedAt));
  ```

## Privacy Guarantees

### ‚úÖ What is NOW Protected:
1. **User Note Isolation**: Each user only sees their own notes
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Old notes (without userId) are still visible to maintain data integrity
3. **Automatic userId Assignment**: New notes automatically get the current user's ID

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Considerations:
1. **Old Notes**: Notes created before this implementation have no userId and are visible to all users
   - Solution: Run a migration script to assign these notes to the current user
2. **Shared Device**: Notes remain in local storage after logout
   - Current Behavior: Notes are filtered, not deleted
   - Alternative: Clear Hive box on logout (data loss risk)

### üì± Shared Notes (Family Feature):
- Shared notes are stored in Firestore with `familyId`
- Only accessible to family members
- Properly isolated per family

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Note Isolation
1. Login as User A
2. Create notes
3. Logout
4. Login as User B
5. Create different notes
6. Verify User B CANNOT see User A's notes
7. Logout User B, login as User A
8. Verify User A sees their notes but NOT User B's notes

### Test Case 2: New Note Creation
1. Login as any user
2. Create a new note
3. Check Hive database and verify note has userId field populated

### Test Case 3: Family Shared Notes
1. Login as family member
2. Navigate to Family Hub
3. Verify shared notes load without errors (no index error)
4. Verify shared notes are visible to all family members

## Migration Path for Existing Notes

If you want to assign existing notes to the current user, run this migration once:

```dart
// Migration script (run once in main.dart or a migration screen)
Future<void> migrateNotesToCurrentUser() async {
  final userId = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.uid;
  if (userId == null) return;
  
  final box = Hive.box<NoteModel>(AppConstants.notesBox);
  for (var note in box.values) {
    if (note.userId == null || note.userId!.isEmpty) {
      final updatedNote = note.copyWith(userId: userId);
      await box.put(note.id, updatedNote);
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `lib/data/models/note_model.dart` - Added userId field
2. `lib/data/models/note_model.g.dart` - Regenerated Hive adapter
3. `lib/data/repositories/note_repository.dart` - Added filtering and auto-assignment
4. `lib/features/family/providers/family_providers.dart` - Fixed Firestore index error

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add logout confirmation dialog mentioning notes will be hidden
- [ ] Optional: Implement note sync to Firestore for cloud backup
- [ ] Optional: Add migration button in settings to assign old notes to current user
- [ ] Test thoroughly with multiple users
